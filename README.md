# MarketPlace Case
The data set used for this case was obtained from Kaggle and consists of data from approximately 100k sales made in several Brazilian Marketplaces between 2016 and 2018. The site in question allows sellers and buyers to connect using its platform and when a purchase is closed, delivery can be made directly to the buyer using one of the logistics partners. Once the purchase is closed, the seller is prompted to close the order. As soon as the order is delivered, or when it reaches the estimated delivery date, the customer receives a satisfaction survey by email to evaluate the purchase, giving a note for the experience and with a free field for comments. The test as described, you are expected to analyze the data presented above, build queries and with the result, create graphs and/or dashboards that help us to better understand some things that happen with this Marketplace. With them, you should help us to better understand the three bass questions.

# Questions 

1- How many and which are the main categories that account for 50% of sales in this MarketPlace? What percentage of the average ticket is owed to them?

2-In the purchasing process, which of the process steps causes the most delays? (Approval of payment, delivery to the carrier, or delivery to the customer). What do you propose as a solution to improve the process and reduce the number of delays?

3- Can you say that there is any relationship between the review being bad and the order being late? If the number of times this occurs is relevant, what do you propose as a way to mitigate this problem?
